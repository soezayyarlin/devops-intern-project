# My DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey! This repository documents my step-by-step progress, the projects I’ve worked on, and the tools and skills I’m developing along the way. I'm starting as a beginner and aiming to master essential DevOps tools and practices.

## 📅 Goals
- **Short-term:** Learn the fundamentals of Git, GitHub, cloud computing, and containerization.
- **Long-term:** Gain proficiency in key DevOps tools like AWS, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

## 📚 Tools & Technologies
Here’s a list of the main tools I'm focusing on learning:
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Jenkins
- **Containers:** Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
